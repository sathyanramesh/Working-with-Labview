# Working-with-Labview
This is a small work of mine on LabView .
The Questions are:

#Numeric, Stuctures, Boolean and TImings Palette

1)

• Create a VI that do the following
• adds two numbers
• subtracts one number from another
• multiplies two numbers together
• divides one number by another,
• squares the 1 st number,
• square roots the 1 st number,
• averages both numbers
• maximum of both numbers
• minimum of both numbers

All must use same input terminals, and same output terminal. Have an enumeration
control, that chooses the operation to be performed.

2)

• Use a for loop to generate 50 random numbers. Determine the most current maximum and
minimum number as the random numbers are being generated. This is sometimes referred
to as a “running” maximum and minimum. Display the running maximum and minimum
values as well as the current random number on the front panel. Provide sufficient time gap
for the user to view the results. Display iteration count.

3)

• Create a VI that generates an array of a specified length of uniformly distributed random
numbers with a range of (0-0.2] and from [0.3-1), In other words, the standard range for the
random number generator but without any values between 0.2 and 0.3. Calculate the
mean, standard deviation and root mean square of the array. User should be able to set the
default length of the array.

4)

• Create a time trial program to compare the average execution times of the “Formula Node”
and the native LabVIEW Math Function. Display which method is fastest. To test the timing,
using the following formulas:
Where X is the input and Y is the output. Run the time trial for each of the
cases. Which method has the fastest execution time?

a = (X ^ 2) / 4;
b = 2X + 1;
Y = sin (a+b);
